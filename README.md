Connaissance

Connaissance is an application that utilizes user location to determine nearby food options. From someone who is often 
indecisive about what they want to eat, I find myself needing a second opinion for what's for dinner. This Connaissance 
application will take user preferences, profile, past choices, and location to help narrow nearby options. The primary goal 
of this application is to allow users to find suitable food choices in unfamiliar locations.
